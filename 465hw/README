		i. The new probability for day 1 to be hot in the initial construction is 0.491.
		p(HHH,133) = 0.5*0.8*0.8*0.1*0.7*0.7 = 0.001568
		p(CHH,133) = 0.5*0.1*0.8*0.7*0.7*0.7 = 0.001372
		Then we shall compute p(HHH|133) = p(HHH,133)/p(133) = 

		ii. Before the change, the day 2 hot probability is 0.977 after the change the probability is 0.918. Cell K28 is denoting this.
		iii. After 10 iterations the before probability is 1 and 1, the after probability is 0 and 0.577.

	(b)
		i. p(1=H) immedietly go down to 0. But the rest of the graph seems to be unaffected. 
		ii. After 10 iterations, it drags the first 3 days down, but the change is merely observable.
		iii. I have to say it is still 0, during all 10 iterations, p(1|H) doesn't change, but the emission probability does change, from initially p(2|H) = 0.3 and p(2|H) = 0/7 to almost equal.
